Project Title: Instagram Post Interface

Description:

I recently completed a project where I built an Instagram post interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API. This project showcases my skills in front-end development and my ability to integrate APIs to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Features:

HTML & CSS: Structured and styled the layout to closely mimic the look and feel of an Instagram post, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
JavaScript: Implemented interactivity, including like buttons, comments section, and post creation.
API Integration: Used an API to fetch and display user data, post content, and comments in real-time, simulating a live Instagram feed experience.
Key Highlights:

Responsive Design: Ensured the interface is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
User Interaction: Enabled users to like posts, add comments, and view the number of likes and comments dynamically.
Dynamic Content: Fetched real-time data from an API, allowing the content to update seamlessly without refreshing the page.
Technologies Used:

This project was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge of front-end development and improve my skills in working with APIs. I am excited to continue building more dynamic and user-friendly web applications in the future!
